 * Where the finite-capacity scheduler asks how many people it can count on.

 * already implemented outside core, and adding methods to it would stop every
 * existing implementation from loading. A provider that records crews, absences
 * and skills binds this one as well; an installation that records none of it
 * keeps the null implementation and scheduling stays machine-constrained only.
 *
 * Both methods answer for a whole window, so an implementation can fold shifts,
 * approved absences and break windows into one number. `null` means "nothing
 * here constrains it" — never "nobody": a provider that knows there is nobody
 * returns 0.
